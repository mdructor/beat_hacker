# beat hacker

<a href="http://beathacker.rocks" target="_blank">CHECK OUT OUR PROJECT LIVE HERE!!!</a>

Beat hacker is a rhythm simulation game designed to teach people how 
to program beats digitally. It features a simple beat sequencer, similar
to what you would see in modern digital audio workstations(DAWs) that can
be toyed with freely to learn how to use the sequencer. The game aspect
happens when the user chooses a level to play, and a beat gets played back to
them.  The goal as the user is to recreate the beat they hear in the sequencer, ultimately training the user how to become a better digital
drummer.

Note: This project is currently frozen as a submission to Hacklahoma2020. 
It was fully developed from scratch by Mason Dructor and Ford Chastain
from 12:00PM Feb 8, 2020 and 11:00AM Feb 9, 2020.
